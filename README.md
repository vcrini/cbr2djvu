# cbr2djvu
Used to convert from Comic Book Archive (cbr) format to DjVu. 

Usage:

cbr2djvu.py foo.cbr

creates a foo.djvu version of the input file.

Notes:

This utility works only under linux (and maybe also under Mac).
In order to work you need following: 

* Python 2.7 (lower may work but I didn't tested)
* Imagemagick
* pdf2djvu
